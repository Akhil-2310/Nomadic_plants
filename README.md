# Nomadic_plants
Nomadic Plants is a Web3 protocol connecting nomadic people to local environments through shared plant stewardship. Each physical plant is paired with an NFT that records care, location, and handovers as people move while plants stay rooted. Built for the localism track, it enables place-based continuity, responsibility, and care beyond ownership.
